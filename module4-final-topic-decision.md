Module 4: Feasibility Assessment and Final Topic Decision
Course: CSN 190 – Cybersecurity Capstone
Name: Christopher Perez
Date: October 10, 2025

Part A – Comprehensive Topic Analysis
Topic: Ransomware Evolution & Defense Strategies

1. Feasibility Assessment
For this project, I’ll focus on studying how ransomware attacks have changed over time and how different defense tools can detect or stop them early. I’ll use a virtual lab setup with Metasploitable, Metasploit, Nmap, and Wireshark, since we already use these in class and they’re safe for controlled testing. I’ll also explore open-source tools like Raccine and Velociraptor, which are made for early detection and response. My current skill level is around 3/5.  I’m confident setting up VMs and scanning networks, but I’ll need to learn more about malware behavior and system monitoring.

I have access to all needed tools, research papers, and online resources. The main thing I’ll need to study more is how ransomware encrypts data, how to analyze logs, and how defense tools react to those attacks. Everything can be done inside a virtual environment, which keeps it safe and realistic for an 8–10 week project.

For Project-Based Topics:
I’ll simulate ransomware like activity in my virtual machines and test how defensive tools respond. My environment will use VirtualBox with Windows and Linux VMs, plus monitoring tools like Wireshark. The project is realistic within 8–10 weeks if I focus on data collection, analysis, and comparison instead of building a large tool from scratch.

For Research-Based Topics:
The research side will include case studies, academic articles, and cybersecurity reports on how ransomware has evolved since 2010, especially the rise of double-extortion and Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS). I’ll compare how older detection methods differ from newer behavioral and AI based ones. I’ll also include real data from Chainalysis and Sophos reports to show the scale of ransomware’s growth.
2. Learning and Growth Potential
This topic will help me grow in both technical and analytical ways. Technically, I’ll learn more about malware behavior, digital forensics, and system monitoring. I’ll also gain hands on experience using tools that professionals in incident response use. On the research side, I’ll learn how to combine technical testing with real world data to find trends and conclusions.

The biggest challenge will be safely running simulations and making sure I don’t accidentally harm my system. But I’m excited about it because ransomware is one of the most serious threats today, and understanding how it works is a major step toward becoming a cybersecurity professional. This connects directly to my career goal of working in digital forensics or incident response.

Summary:
Both topics are interesting, but ransomware fits better for me right now. It’s hands on, technical, and directly tied to my career path. The government surveillance topic would definitely be exciting because I like exposing the truth and questioning what’s really happening behind the scenes but the problem is there’s not enough solid evidence out there to fully support my claims without it sounding like a conspiracy theory. That’s why I decided to go with ransomware instead. It’s something I can actually test, measure, and back up with real data, while still learning the same investigative mindset that first got me interested in cybersecurity.
Part C – Final Topic Selection
1. Final Choice
I chose Ransomware Evolution & Defense Strategies for my final capstone topic. In this project, I’ll research how ransomware has developed over the years and what defense tools are most effective at stopping it. I’ll use a virtual lab setup with Metasploitable, Metasploit, Nmap, and Wireshark to simulate attack activity safely. I’ll also test open-source detection tools like Raccine and Velociraptor to see how they respond to simulated ransomware behavior.
2. Why This Topic
This topic is both achievable and challenging. It’s achievable because I already know how to set up virtual machines and use tools like Metasploit, but it’s challenging enough to push me to learn more about malware detection and forensic analysis. It’s meaningful because ransomware affects real people, companies, and even hospitals. Every year it causes billions of dollars in losses, and defenders are constantly trying to stay one step ahead. Working on this topic gives me a chance to understand how those defenses work and maybe even come up with new ideas for improvement. This project balances feasibility and growth perfectly and lines up with my long term goal of working in incident response or digital forensics.
3. Three-Tier Plan
- Ambitious Goal: Build a simple script that can detect suspicious ransomware like file encryption behavior and log it in real time.
- Realistic Target: Use my virtual lab to simulate ransomware and measure how tools like Raccine and Velociraptor detect or stop it.
- Minimum Viable Outcome: Write a full report on how ransomware has evolved and which defense strategies are most effective according to current research and my testing.
4. The Learning Value

This topic will teach me how to safely test and analyze malware behavior in a lab, how detection tools work, and how to document cybersecurity experiments. Even if I don’t complete every part, I’ll still gain valuable experience in threat detection, analysis, and response — real-world skills that will help me in my cybersecurity career. Attempting something ambitious like this shows I’m serious about learning and ready to take on challenges that matter in the real world.
