## Summary
Module 6 was the beginning of hands-on cybersecurity development. I started using Wireshark inside Kali Linux and captured traffic from Metasploitable2.

## Key Tasks
- Set up VMs in VirtualBox using NAT Network.
- Used Wireshark to analyze ICMP echo requests and replies.
- Captured traffic between Kali Linux and Metasploitable2.
- Created screenshots and notes for the final tutorial.

## Skills Learned
- Packet analysis
- Virtual network configuration
- Technical documentation

## Files Created
- SETUP-GUIDE.md (added later to /docs)
- ICMP Traffic Analysis Tutorial (added later to /docs)
