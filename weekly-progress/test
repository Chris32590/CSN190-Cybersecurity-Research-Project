# Week 1 – Initial Setup and Topic Exploration

## What I Did This Week
- Set up my GitHub repository for the CSN190 final project.
- Completed the pre-assessment and reviewed the course structure.
- Explored cybersecurity project ideas, including password cracking, network analysis, and vulnerability scanning.
- Evaluated several GitHub security projects to find one suitable for cloning and analysis.

## Challenges
- Narrowing down a topic because many cybersecurity tools were interesting.
- Deciding whether to focus on offensive or defensive security.

## What I Learned
- How to properly document a project on GitHub.
- How to analyze and evaluate open-source cybersecurity tools.
- Importance of version control for cybersecurity research.

## Plans for Next Week
- Finalize my project topic.
- Begin gathering academic and industry resources.



# Week 2 – Resource Analysis and Topic Decision

## What I Did This Week
- Completed the Resource Analysis assignment.
- Located credible research sources, including academic papers and industry articles.
- Evaluated how each source supports my chosen tool (Wireshark).
- Finalized my project: **Network Traffic Analysis Using Wireshark**.

## Challenges
- Finding academic sources that relate specifically to packet analysis.
- Understanding some advanced Wireshark features.

## What I Learned
- Difference between general cybersecurity sources and tool-specific research.
- How Wireshark is used by network analysts, SOC teams, and penetration testers.

## Plans for Next Week
- Begin writing the feasibility assessment.
- Start planning the lab environment setup.


# Week 3 – Feasibility Assessment & Environment Planning

## What I Did This Week
- Completed the Feasibility Assessment.
- Designed the environment: VirtualBox + Kali Linux + Metasploitable2.
- Decided on test traffic types (ICMP, TCP handshake capture, credentials capture).
- Wrote out the lab setup procedure.

## Challenges
- Making sure my computer had enough RAM to run 2 VMs.
- Understanding the NAT network configuration in VirtualBox.

## What I Learned
- How to configure isolated lab networks safely.
- Why Metasploitable2 is ideal for controlled attacks.
- How Wireshark captures packets at different layers.

## Plans for Next Week
- Start building the actual environment.
- Begin testing network traffic captures.


# Week 4 – Virtual Lab Setup & Initial Testing

## What I Did This Week
- Installed VirtualBox, Kali Linux, and Metasploitable2.
- Created an internal NAT network for safe traffic testing.
- Installed Wireshark on Kali.
- Performed my first simple packet capture (ICMP ping).

## Challenges
- VirtualBox networking settings were confusing at first.
- Wireshark captured too much noise — had to apply filters.

## What I Learned
- How to use Wireshark filters: `icmp`, `http`, `tcp.port==80`.
- How to generate traffic between VMs and analyze responses.
- Basics of packet structure (Ethernet header, IP header, TCP header).

## Plans for Next Week
- Perform deeper packet analysis.
- Capture more complex traffic.



# Week 5 – Deeper Wireshark Analysis

## What I Did This Week
- Captured ICMP, ARP, and TCP handshake packets.
- Followed packet streams to understand communication flow.
- Used display filters and color rules to clean up captures.
- Documented findings in my notes and GitHub “your-work” folder.

## Challenges
- Understanding TCP flags like SYN, ACK, FIN.
- Keeping captures organized.

## What I Learned
- How Wireshark reconstructs conversations.
- How attackers use packet analysis to find weaknesses.
- How ARP spoofing works and how Wireshark detects anomalies.

## Plans for Next Week
- Begin writing the Medium article first draft.
- Capture screenshots for documentation.



# Week 6 – Medium Article (First Draft)

## What I Did This Week
- Started writing the Medium Article draft.
- Collected screenshots from Wireshark captures.
- Explained installation, setup, and ICMP traffic analysis.
- Outlined the entire article structure (title → research → conclusion).

## Challenges
- Keeping the article within 1500–2500 words.
- Figuring out how to present technical content in a simple way.

## What I Learned
- How to write cybersecurity explanations for a general audience.
- Importance of documenting commands and visuals.
- How Medium authors structure step-by-step tutorials.

## Plans for Next Week
- Finish the article draft.
- Submit for instructor feedback.



# Week 7 – Final Draft Improvements

## What I Did This Week
- Revised the Medium article based on feedback.
- Added missing screenshots and fixed formatting.
- Cleaned up the GitHub repository structure.
- Wrote README files for each folder.

## Challenges
- Making sure all screenshots were labeled properly.
- Improving clarity in the tutorial sections.

## What I Learned
- How to structure a professional GitHub repository.
- How to write clearer technical documentation.
- How to merge research with hands-on experience.

## Plans for Next Week
- Prepare final submission.
- Record final video (if required by professor).



# Week 8 – Final Submission Preparation

## What I Did This Week
- Completed the final draft of the Medium article.
- Uploaded all source code, captures, and documentation.
- Verified the repository meets Module 8 structure requirements.
- Finalized README.md and resources folder.
- Prepared everything for Brightspace submission.

## Challenges
- Ensuring every required file was included.
- Making the repository easy to navigate.

## What I Learned
- How to deliver a complete cybersecurity research project.
- How to present technical findings professionally.
- Importance of clear documentation for cybersecurity work.

## Final Step
- Submit GitHub link + PDF drafts to Brightspace.
