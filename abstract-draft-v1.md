Module 4.2 – Abstract Draft with Implementation Focus
Title: Ransomware Evolution & Defense Strategies

Ransomware has evolved from simple file locking malware to complex, multi-stage attacks that cause billions of dollars in damage each year.
This project studies how ransomware has changed and tests modern defense tools that can detect or stop these attacks.
Using a virtual lab built with Metasploitable, Metasploit, and Wireshark, I’ll simulate ransomware like activity to observe how it behaves on a system.
Then, I’ll test open-source tools like Raccine and Velociraptor to measure how quickly and accurately they detect malicious behavior. 
The research side of this project will analyze major ransomware trends from 2010 to 2025 and review case studies from industry reports. 
The goal is to identify which detection methods work best before encryption starts and what organizations can do to reduce damage. 
The final outcome will be a report combining both research and practical testing, highlighting which defense approaches are most reliable against modern ransomware.

Self-Evaluation

My abstract includes all five required parts: background, problem statement, purpose, methods, and expected results. It clearly states what I’m doing and why it matters. 
I used specific terms like Metasploit, Raccine, and Velociraptor to make it concrete instead of vague. 
The hardest part was keeping everything under 200 words while still explaining both the research and hands-on parts clearly.
I wrote it in a simple and straightforward way that sounds like me, not like a formal paper. It aligns with my feasibility analysis because it focuses on the same tools and realistic goals.
The project is ambitious but still doable within the semester, and the abstract shows that I understand exactly what I want to accomplish and how I plan to do it.
